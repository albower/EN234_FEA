!      Conventions for storing tensors:
!
!      Deformation gradients are provided as components in the global basis
!      (ABAQUS also allows the user to define a fixed local coord system defined with *ORIENTATION)
!
!      Stresses and stretches are stored as components in a basis that 'rotates with the material'
!      These are defined as follows:
!          Let e_i be the initial basis vectors (the global ijk directions, or user-specified basis vectors)
!          Let R be the rotation tensor, defined through the polar decomposition of deformation gradient F=RU=VR
!          Then define rotated basis vectors m_i = R e_i.
!          The co-rotational components of a tensor are defined as A_ij = m_i . A . m_j
!          The components A_ij can also be interpreted as the global components of the tensor  R^T A R
!
!
!      The components of symmetric tensors (stress,strainInc and stretch) are stored as vectors in the following order
!                      For 3D problems (ndir=3,nshr=3) [11,22,33,12,23,13]
!                      For 2D problems (ndir=3,nshr=1) [11,22,33,12]
!      The components of unsymmetric tensors (defgrad and relSpinInc) are stored as vectors in the following order
!                      For 3D problems (ndir=3,nshr=3) [11,22,33,12,23,31,21,32,13]
!                      For 2D problems (ndir=3,nshr=1) [11,22,33,12,21]
!
!      The stresses are Cauchy (true) stress
!
!      nblock                   No. integration points in data block (data are provided in 'blocks' of integration points)
!                               EN234FEA always has only 1 int pt in each block
!      ndir                     No. direct tensor components
!      nshr                     No. shear tensor components
!      nstatev                  No. user defined state variables (declared in input file)
!      nprops                   No. material properties
!      lanneal                  Annealing flag - if set to 1, then stresses are zeroed, and state vars should be reset to initial state
!      stepTime                 Elapsed time in this step at end of increment
!      totalTime                Total elapsed time at end of time increment
!      dt                       time step
!      cmname                   Material name
!      coordMp(n,i)             ith coord of nth integration point
!      charLength(i)            Characteristic length of element (in EN234FEA this is (element volume)^1/3)
!      props(k)                 kth material property
!      density                  density
!      strainInc(n,i)           ith strain increment component for nth int pt.  Strain components are in a
!                               basis that rotates with material, stored in order [de11, de22, de33, de12, de23, de13]
!                               NOTE THAT SHEAR STRAIN COMPONENTS ARE NOT DOUBLED IN THE VECTOR
!      relSpinInc(n,i)          ith component of relative spin increment tensor.   The global components of relSpinInc are
!                               dW_ij - dR_ij   where dW is the skew part of displacement gradient increment, and
!                               dR_ij is the rotation increment.
!      tempOld                  Temperature at start of increment
