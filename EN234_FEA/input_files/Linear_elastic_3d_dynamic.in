% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% MESH DEFINITION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
    MESH

%    The NODE command defines properties of the nodes.  
%    The parameters are # of coords, # of DOF, and an optional integer identifier
       NODES
%    The parameters are # of coords, # of DOF, and an optional integer identifier
       PARAMETERS, 3, 3, 1
%      Specify which nodal DOF are displacements.  In the example, DOF 1 is the x displacement, 2 is the y displacement, 3 is the z displacement
       DISPLACEMENT DOF, 1, 2, 3
%    Enter x,y,z coords of nodes.   The node number is optional, and is ignored in the code.

%      The DISTRIBUTED LOAD key sets up prescribed (nominal) tractions on element faces
%       The syntax is one of the following options:
%           element set, face #, VALUE, tx,(ty),(tz)        (applies constant pressure/flux to element face in direction DOF)
%           element set, face #, HISTORY,history name, nx,(ny),(nz) (time dependent traction or flux to element face in direction (nx,ny,nz))
%           element set, face #, NORMAL, history name     (applies time dependent pressure normal to element face)
%           element set, face #, SUBROUTINE, subroutine parameter name
%
%       We apply a constant traction to the end element - produces a roughly constant acceleration of the two elements plus some vibration....

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Analysis %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%   The EXPLICIT DYNAMIC STEP key initializes a dynamic load step

     EXPLICIT DYNAMIC STEP

%        The TIME STEP key defines values of parameters controlling time stepping.
%        The parameters are time step, no. steps, no. steps between state prints, no. steps between user prints
%        All parameters are required

          TIME STEP, 0.01

          USER PRINT STEPS, 210


%      This prints the DOF values and projected nodal state for all solid elements to a tecplot readable file
%      Nodal variables are printed as
%         X, Y, (Z), Ux, Uy, (Uz), Projected states.
%         The projected states are controlled by the user - see subroutine elstat in file usrelem.f90
%         Also (for this example file) subroutine state_linelast_3dbasic in file el_linelast_3Dbasic.f90
%         In this example the states are the stresses sxx,syy,szz,sxy,sxz,syz
