    MESH

%    The NODE command defines properties of the nodes.  
%    The parameters are # of coords, # of DOF, and an optional integer identifier
       NODES
%    The parameters are # of coords, # of DOF, and an optional integer identifier
       PARAMETERS, 3, 3, 1
%      Specify which nodal DOF are displacements.  In the example, DOF 1 is the x displacement, 2 is the y displacement, 3 is the z displacement
       DISPLACEMENT DOF, 1, 2, 3
%    Enter x,y,z coords of nodes.   The node number is optional, and is ignored in the code.

%       The DEGREE OF FREEDOM key assigns values to nodal DOFs
%       The syntax is node set name, DOF number, and either a value or a history name.

%   the residual force vector is consistent with the stiffness
%   The syntax is CHECK STIFFNESS, element flag (or Un for an ABAQUS element)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Analysis %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

   %   The STATIC STEP key initializes a static load step

%        The SOLVER key controls the equation solver and Newton-Raphson iterations
%        The options are FACTOR for direct solver, CONJUGATE GRADIENT for cg solver
%        Factor will work on anything but might be slow for large equation systems.   
%        Conjugate gradient works well for elasticity problems but (with the diagonal preconditioner used here) is not so good for unsymmetric matrices
%                        LINEAR for linear equations, NONLINEAR for nonlinear equations
%                        For nonlinear solver, must specify convergence tolerance and max # iterations
%                        UNSYMMETRIC  (optional - only for unsymmetric stiffness)
%        It is silly to use the nonlinear option for linear elasticity, but is included here for demonstration purposes.
