    MESH

%    The NODE command defines properties of the nodes.  
%    The parameters are # of coords, # of DOF, and an optional integer identifier
       NODES
%    The parameters are # of coords, # of DOF, and an optional integer identifier
       PARAMETERS, 2, 2, 1
%      Specify which nodal DOF are displacements.  In the example, DOF 1 is the x displacement, 2 is the y displacement, 3 is the z displacement
       DISPLACEMENT DOF, 1, 2
%    Enter x,y,z coords of nodes.   The node number is optional, and is ignored in the code.

%                        For nonlinear solver, must specify convergence tolerance and max # iterations
