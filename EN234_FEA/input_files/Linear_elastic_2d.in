% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% MESH DEFINITION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
    MESH

%    The NODE command defines properties of the nodes.  
%    The parameters are # of coords, # of DOF, and an optional integer identifier
       NODES
%    The parameters are # of coords, # of DOF, and an optional integer identifier
       PARAMETERS, 2, 2, 1
%      Specify which nodal DOF are displacements.  In the example, DOF 1 is the x displacement, 2 is the y displacement, 3 is the z displacement
       DISPLACEMENT DOF, 1, 2
%    Enter x,y,z coords of nodes.   The node number is optional, and is ignored in the code.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BOUNDARY CONDITIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%     The BOUNDARY conditions key starts definition of BCs
      BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

%       The HISTORY key defines a time history that can be applied to DOFs or distributed loads
        HISTORY, dof_history
          0.d0, 0.d0                  % Each line gives a time value and then a function value

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Mesh printing, error checking %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%  Print the initial mesh to a file named initial_mesh.dat

   PRINT INITIAL MESH, initial_mesh.dat

%   TIME, VALUE, 0.d0        % Use this to specify the initial time
%   TIME, INCREMENT, 0.01d0  % Use this to specify a time increment (often needed for check stiffness)

%   The CHECK STIFFNESS key tests the element subroutine to ensure that
%   the residual force vector is consistent with the stiffness
       CHECK STIFFNESS, 101




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Analysis %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

   %   The STATIC STEP key initializes a static load step

     STATIC STEP

          MAX NUMBER OF STEPS, 3
          STOP TIME, 10.d0
          STATE PRINT STEP INTERVAL, 1
          USER PRINT STEP INTERVAL, 1


%        The SOLVER key controls the equation solver and Newton-Raphson iterations
%        The options are FACTOR for direct solver, CONJUGATE GRADIENT for cg solver
%        Factor will work on anything but might be slow for large equation systems.   
%        Conjugate gradient works well for elasticity problems but (with the diagonal preconditioner used here) is not so good for unsymmetric matrices
%                        LINEAR for linear equations, NONLINEAR for nonlinear equations
%                        For nonlinear solver, must specify convergence tolerance and max # iterations
%                        UNSYMMETRIC  (optional - only for unsymmetric stiffness)

%      This prints the DOF values and projected nodal state for all solid elements to a tecplot readable file
%      Nodal variables are printed as
%         X, Y, (Z), Ux, Uy, (Uz), Projected states.
%         The projected states are controlled by the user - see subroutine elstat in file usrelem.f90
%         Also (for this example file) subroutine state_linelast_3dbasic in file el_linelast_3Dbasic.f90
